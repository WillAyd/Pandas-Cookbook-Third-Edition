# Pandas Cookbook, Third Edition
**Practical recipes for scientific computing, time series, and exploratory data analysis using Python**

This is the code repository for [Pandas Cookbook, Third Edition](https://github.com/WillAyd/Pandas-Cookbook-Third-Edition), published by Packt.

## About the book ðŸ“”

The pandas library is massive, and it's common for frequent users to be unaware of many of its more impressive features. The official pandas documentation, while thorough, does not contain many useful examples of how to piece together multiple commands as one would do during an actual analysis. This book guides you, as if you were looking over the shoulder of an expert, through situations that you are highly likely to encounter.  
 
With this latest edition unlock the full potential of pandas 2.x onwards. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data analyst, this book offers a wealth of practical recipes to help you excel in your data analysis projects. This cookbook covers everything from fundamental data manipulation tasks to advanced techniques for handling big data, visualization, and more. Each recipe is designed to address common real-world challenges, providing clear explanations and step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process.  
 
Explore cutting-edge topics such as idiomatic pandas coding, efficient handling of large datasets, and advanced data visualization techniques.â€¯ Whether you're looking to sharpen or expand your skills, the *Pandas Cookbook* is your essential companion for mastering data analysis and manipulation with pandas 2.x, and beyond.

## Getting started ðŸš€
The code in this book will make use of the pandas, NumPy, and PyArrow libraries. Jupyter Notebook files are also a popular way to visualize and inspect code. All of these libraries should be installable via `pip` or the package manager of your choice. For `pip` users, you can run:
```bash
python -m pip install pandas numpy pyarrow notebook
```
### Running a Jupyter notebook ðŸ’»
The suggested method to work through the content of this book is to have a Jupyter notebook up and running so that you can run the code while reading through the recipes.  Following along on your computer allows you to go off exploring on your own and gain a deeper understanding than by just reading the book alone.

After installing Jupyter notebook, open a Command Prompt (type `cmd` at the search bar on Windows, or open Terminal on Mac or Linux) and type:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
